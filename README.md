# Travel Planner App Project

## Overview
I am building a travel application.

The project will include a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving.

If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast.

This project requires me to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.
